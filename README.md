## Problem Statement
Design Python classes for web page and Grobid output schemas, validating data with Pydantic and creating "clean" CSV files. Utilize DBT with Snowflake to load clean data, construct a summary table, and deploy the model with testing. Establish Test and Production Environments in Snowflake, considering necessary considerations for deployment.

## Project Goals
Design and implement Python classes, namely URLClass, MetaDataPDFClass, and ContentPDFClass, to represent the schema for webpages and Grobid output (Part 1). Utilize Pydantic for data and schema validation, generating "clean" CSV files, and creating 5+5 test cases for validation success/failure. For Part 2, use DBT with Snowflake to load clean data, create a summary table schema, materialize it, write tests, and document the model. Additionally, set up Test and Production Environments in Snowflake, considering relevant considerations for each.
